Mini Project: Token-based Authentication Flow in Postman

Scenario Overview:
You log in to an API using credentials
The API returns a token in the response
You store that token in an environment variable
You use the token in another API request to access protected data

Project Goals
Automate token retrieval through a login request
Store token dynamically in an environment variable
Use the token in headers for authenticated requests
Add test validations for successful login and token presence

Tools Used
Postman

Deliverables
✅ Postman Collection containing authenticated API requests
✅ Environment file with dynamic token storage
✅ Working Pre-request and Tests scripts for token management

End Result
🟩 A real-world project with authentication and API chaining
Real-world confidence to automate a complete login →
token extraction → data request flow using Postman variables and scripts
